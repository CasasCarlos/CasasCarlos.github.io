“You will always  Hate Yourself”


When they are in line 
They’re in crosshair
Would they be fine 
If not, be your hare.


  Have your finger
Have calm and steady
Be ready to pull trigger
Control your emotion of medley


 Feel the recoil 
Smell the scent of the casing
You know your blood boil
But you embracing 


You hate being a sniper
But you always be a viper.
